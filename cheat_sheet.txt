Create a new branch with git and manage branche
===============================================
When you do a pull request on a branch, you can continue to work on another branch and make another pull request on this other branch.
Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.
$ git pull

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push the branch on github :
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

When you want to commit something in your branch, be sure to be in your branch. Add -u parameter to set-upstream.
You can see all the branches created by using :
$ git branch -a

Which will show :
* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean

Add a new remote for your branch :
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] [name_of_your_new_branch]

Push changes from your commit into your branch :
$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [url]

Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]

Then you need to apply to merge changes if your branch is derivated from develop you need to do :
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop

Delete a branch on your local filesystem :
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]

To force the deletion of local branch on your filesystem :
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]

Delete the branch on github :
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]

Following are basic command to setup your git repo...
echo "# imageGallery" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/penseurtank/imageGallery.git
git push -u origin main
